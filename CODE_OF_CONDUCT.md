# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

## "Our World Is One Country"

Globe&Citizen, as a company and service, is based on the premise that people are _people_ all around the world and that all humans display the unique capacity to cooperate flexibly in groups. Participation requires, above all else, a willingness to work with other developers who are different from yourself respectfully, openly, in good faith.

## Steps to Contributing

1. Fork a local copy of the code base and get to know it.
2. Create your own development branch off of the shared "develop" branch to work on locally.
3. Push to your forked repository and then open a 'pull' request.
